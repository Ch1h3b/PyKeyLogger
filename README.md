# Simple PyKeyLogger
I wanted to write a clean simple python keyLogger.
Capturing Keys using pynput, and sending them from and to a custom email via smtplib.
## Usage
```bash
pip install pynput
python keylogger.py
```
<br>
The escape key is used to break out of the loop, you probably do not always want that.
<br>

Using `pyInstaller` to create an excuatble is also possible.
<br>
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile keylogger.py
```
